Hello!

I'm currently a Biostatistics MS student at Vanderbilt University. My undergraduate degree is from Carleton College where I received a double major in Physics and Geology. I worked at the Food and Drug Administration from 2017 to 2020 in the Division of Antiviral Products where I conducted research on adverse events in patients taking drugs for hepatitis C and HIV.
